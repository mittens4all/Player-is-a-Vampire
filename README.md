# Player is a Vampire

This behavior pack adds the `minecraft:burns_in_daylight` entity component to the player.json. Players will burn in the daylight. It may conflict with other packs that use player.json.

## Installing the pack:

Add the Player is a Vampire add-on to your behavior packs on your world. Behavior packs disable achievements, but editing the world with an NBT editor can re-enable achievements when uploading your world to a realm.

Re-enable achievements on either pc or mobile with the free NBT editor [Dovetail](https://github.com/Offroaders123/Dovetail)
